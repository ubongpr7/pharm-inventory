sentence="""
I am Ubong Prosper, and I am a passionate full-stack Django developer with a vision to build software solution for businesses. I have been working tirelessly on an inventory management software that I believe will not only transform how businesses handle their stock but will also change my life forever and that of my family.
Right now, I am at a crossroads. I have no money, no job, and no means to keep pushing forward. My internet data is about to run out, and without it, I won’t be able to continue developing this software that could be my ticket out of poverty.
Why This Software Matters
I have been in discussions with a marketing company  through their representative in Akure, Ondo state, Nigeria, and they are interested in partnering with me to deliver this software to their clients. This could be the breakthrough I need, but I am currently struggling to survive, let alone invest in development resources.
This software will help businesses track, manage, and optimize their inventory seamlessly, reducing losses and increasing efficiency. It will be a game-changer for small and medium enterprises, and I am committed to seeing it through.

What I Need
I am not asking for much—just enough support to cover my basic needs and business capital to hire at least two developers to work with me and setup cloud infrastructure for efficient collaboration. A number of developers have signified interest in working with me on the application but lack of money has kept me working on this project alone. I am willing to work day and night to make this dream a reality, but I can’t do it alone.
Your donation will help me:
Stay connected to continue coding and refining the software.
Pay developers who will be working wit me.
Buy food so I can keep my energy up and work efficiently.
Host and test the application on a small server before launching.
How You Can Help
Even the smallest donation can make a difference. With just $5, $10, or $20, you can help me stay online and push this project forward. Your support will not just be a handout; it will be an investment in innovation, a chance to empower a determined developer to create something valuable for businesses.
If you believe in hard work, perseverance, and the power of technology, please consider donating. Your kindness today could change my life and help bring a  solution to my businesses in my community. Be one of the reason I did not quit. If you want to know more about the project, I will be glad to share
Thank you for believing in me!
